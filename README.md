### Based on the data retrieved, the highest percentage of success would be a goal less than $1000. There is a downward trend until the goal of $25000 to $29999, where you see a slight upward trend.

### No difficulties encountered while running analysis. Possible difficulties that could be encounter is economy. Where there could be a low economic stability which one cannot account for while planning to launch a play. 

## Results
- Based on my analysis on the Kickstarter data, the best time to launch a Theater production would be in May, with the highest success goal of under $1000. One could go for a higher goal but will have more of a risk in failure. The month to avoid launch would be in December where there is a %49% success. 
- Limitations of the dataset are of the countries and year collected over 9 years.
- Other possible tables/graphs, box and whiskers to show any outliner data, Bar graph to also compare visually the success vs fail, and could also show a Pie graph.
